        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Generate the 1st \textit{Peano} application from one extension, e.g. \textit{Multigrid}, following the same workflow as above
            \item Generate the 2nd \textit{Peano} application from another extension, e.g. \textit{ExaHyPE}, in a similar fashion
            \item (new feature) Merge the above 2 \texttt{<<peano4>>} Projects coupling solvers from both

    \block{Discussion}{
        In line with the theme proposed for \textit{RSECon24}, this work tries to follow some guiding principles of FAIR for Research Software:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item New ways of coupling solvers for different PDE systems are realised which weren't possible before, thus improving \textit{interoperability}. Various Peano extensions, such as \textit{ExaHyPE} and \textit{Multigrid}, are integrated.
            \item In turn, \textit{reusability} of the extensions as building blocks is enhanced.
        \end{itemize}
    }
