        The Python API simplifies creating applications by writing python scripts within the framework of one Peano extensions.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Old approach} Pick one extension suitable for the given problem (reformulate the problem if necessary) and write within it
            \item \textbf{New approach} Identify parts of the given complex problem suitable for solving by different extensions, implement them each within its extension (e.g. solve hyperbolic equations in \textit{ExaHyPE} and elliptic in \textit{Multigrid}) and generate an application coupling solvers from both
        \end{itemize}
