\block{Motivation}{
    %ExaHyPE was originally designed for hyperbolic problems, many applications in science and engineering require the solution of elliptic problems. ExaHyPE 2's implementation is shipped with benchmarks and applications solving problems in computational astrophysics and fluid dynamics.

        The \texttt{peano4} core is written in C++, but an extensive Python API simplifies creating applications by writing a Python script generating all C++ code constituting a Peano4 application. I pick up one extension (\textit{ExaHyPE}, \textit{Multgrid}, etc.) and write my application using the extension's API. I'm interested to use API from several extensions.
