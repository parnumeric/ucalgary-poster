    In line with the theme proposed for RSECon24, My RSE work tries to follow some guiding principles of FAIR for Research Software:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item My implementation enables new ways of coupling solvers for different PDE systems which weren't possible before, thus improving \textit{interoperability}. Various Peano4 extensions, such as \textit{ExaHyPE} and \textit{Multigrid} become capable of data exchange through API.
        \item This in turn makes easier \textit{reusability} of the extensions as building blocks.
    \end{itemize}
}
